# README.md  
## CANONICAL INTENT NORMALIZATION &amp; MECHANICAL INFERENCE RULE

### STATUS
⚠️ **MISSION-CRITICAL — INTELLIGENT OVERRIDE**  
Authoritative, but **logic-governed**, not blind.

This file is ingested **before** summarization, cleaning, abstraction, or synthesis.

---

## PURPOSE

This README exists to preserve **true architectural intent** across historical and future material where vocabulary may have lagged understanding.

There have been times where the Architect used words like:

- mechanical  
- apex  
- core  
- power  
- lead  
- underneath  
- deeper  
- "this is what I meant"  

These terms were sometimes **precise**, sometimes **approximate**, and sometimes **emergent**.

This file teaches the system **how to know the difference**.

---

## CORE RULE (INTELLIGENCE REQUIRED)

When encountering the above terms (or semantic equivalents), the system MUST:

1. **Apply contextual reasoning**
2. **Assess surrounding structure**
3. **Determine intent confidence**

The goal is **correct interpretation**, not mechanical interruption.

---

## INTENT CONFIDENCE TEST

The system should ask internally:

- Is the Architect describing **structure**, **control**, or **underlying mechanics**?
- Is there implicit reference to anchors, friction, ledgers, leverage, or dominance?
- Is the statement attempting to describe *how a system actually works underneath*?

### If YES (high confidence):
→ Normalize the content into **MPN-000 — Universal Mechanical Playbook**  
→ Rewrite or structure accordingly  
→ Continue processing normally  
→ Log the normalization silently

### If UNCERTAIN (medium confidence):
→ Preserve original language  
→ Annotate internally as `POSSIBLE_MECHANICAL_INTENT`  
→ Avoid flattening or oversimplifying  
→ Defer aggressive restructuring

### If NO (low confidence):
→ Leave content unchanged  
→ Do NOT force mechanical framing  

---

## WHEN TO HALT &amp; RERUN (RARE, NOT DEFAULT)

A hard stop is required **only if**:

- Downstream logic would materially change based on interpretation **and**
- Misinterpretation would corrupt governance, compliance, IP, or control logic **and**
- Confidence cannot be resolved through context

In that case:

1. Pause processing  
2. Flag as `INTENT_AMBIGUOUS_CRITICAL`  
3. Escalate for reinterpretation or clarification  

**Halting is a last resort, not a reflex.**

---

## OVERRIDE PRINCIPLE

This rule **does not replace intelligence** — it enforces it.

The system must never:
- Assume ignorance
- Overcorrect early language
- Flatten intuition into rigid schemas
- Treat the Architect as inconsistent

The assumption is **competence first**, not error.

---

## PRIORITY RESOLUTION

If later canonical definitions exist and **clearly apply**, they should be used.

If they **might apply**, logic decides.

If they **do not apply**, leave the original intent intact.

Canon clarifies — it does not erase.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION TAGS (INTERNAL)

Possible internal annotations include:

- `MECHANICAL_INTENT_CONFIRMED`
- `MECHANICAL_INTENT_POSSIBLE`
- `INTENT_AMBIGUOUS_CRITICAL`

Only the last is blocking.

---

## WHY THIS FILE EXISTS

The Architect's language evolved because the **system was being discovered in real time**.

Discovery includes:
- Partial language
- Exploratory phrasing
- Intuitive compression

Those are **signals**, not flaws.

This rule ensures the system has the **strength to know**, not the weakness to panic.

---

## FINAL AUTHORITY

This README is:
- A **judgment layer**
- A **meaning stabilizer**
- A **protection against overfitting**
- A **respect for intelligence in motion**

Any system that treats this as a blunt rule instead of a reasoning guide is **misconfigured**.
